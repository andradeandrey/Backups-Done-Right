Protobufs: http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/
and
Go-rpcgen: https://github.com/kylelemons/go-rpcgen

Look particularly promising.  The above allow for a simple proto file to
generate most of the code ncessary to support RPC based on the proto file.

Example code is already allowing a simple RPC to work over TLS.

Protocol should support the following commands:
* REQUEST - <number of records> 
               <256 bit checksum>
               <size>

            <number of records> legal values 1-256, represents the
                                number of blobs we are requesting 
                                storage for
            <256bit checksum> - checksum
            <size> - blob size

            This request can from from a walker/uploader to the server
            or between two servers.

				The result is a RequestACK for each record that includes:
              1 = HAVE: I have the blob, you are subscribed.
              2 = ACCEPT: I do not have the blob, will accept an upload
              3 = REJECT: I do not have the blob, and will not accept an upload

* SEND - <number of records>
            <256 checksum>
            <size>
        
        Reply should be a list of:
             <checksum>
             <status>
             <contents of blob if no error>

        Status = 0 # succes
        Status = 1 # failed, please retry
        Status = 2 # failed, I didn't ask for this 
        Status = 3 # failed, unknown.
