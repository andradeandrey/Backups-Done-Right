Backups Done Right depends on 3 external packages that need installed:

1. goconfig, install with:
	$ go get github.com/kless/goconfig/config'

2. gosqlite3, install with:
	$ go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3'

3. go-rpcgen, install with:
	$ go get github.com/kylelemons/go-rpcgen/protoc-gen-go'

Then to make certificates run:
	$ cd Backups-Done-Right/src
	$ ./makecerts <your email address>



Before you can run the software the first time, you need to create
a config file which fits your needs:

	$ cd Backups-Done-Right/etc
	cp config.cfg.example config.cf

Then, edit the config file to your needs.
