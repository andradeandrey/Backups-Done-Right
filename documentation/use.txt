This file should give all informations needed to build, install and run Backups-Done-Right.

## Build				##
##########################################
Backups-Done-Right does depend on some go packages, which in turn depend on some software packages.  The below statement should install the dependencies for most Debian/Ubuntu based systems:

	$ apt-get install libsqlite3-dev libsqlite-dev git mercurial pkg-config

Backups Done Right depends on 3 external go packages that need to be installed.  Set GOPKG to where you want them installed.  Something like export GOPKG=/home/JoeUser/gopkg.  DO *NOT* use ~/gopkg.  To install the dependencies:

goconfig - to install, simply run:

	$ go get github.com/kless/goconfig/config


go-sqlite3 - This requires the sqlite and sql-dev packages to be installed already.  To install, simply run:

	$ go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3


go-rpcgen - to install, simply run:

	$ go get github.com/kylelemons/go-rpcgen/protoc-gen-go

## Run					##
##########################################
Before you can run the software the first time, you need to create a config file which fits your needs. Please copy the example config file:

	$ cd Backups-Done-Right/etc
	$ cp config.cfg.example config.cfg

Then, edit the config file to your needs.

You do also need certificates for the SSL encryption:

	$ cd Backups-Done-Right/src/scripts
	$ ./makecerts <your_email_address>
