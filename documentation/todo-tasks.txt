=== ======  ========== 


#1  Done	Please write very clear documentation about every single field
			in database and descripe what it is for and what should be
			written in it

#2	Tectu	file system walker - depends on #1, iterates over backup_dirs 
			noting any new files, changed files, and deleted files.  Keeps 
			state in sqlite (inode, permission, size, timestamps, uid/gid).  
            Builds queue of new/changed files.  See walker.txt and schema.txt.
#2A unassigned Write a simple example that sends a filename over a channel
#2B done    Write a directory dump command that records all filesystem
            metadata.
#2C done    Write a sqlite3 example that builds a table and does an insert
            and selet.
#2D done    Write an example to implement a reasonable config file format

#3	Unassigned 	Uploader depends on #2 - For each file in the queue it reads, 
			compresses, and checksums it.  Ideally multiple core friendly.  
			As files are finished upload them to p2p server.  See 
			uploader.txt.  Depends on #4 and #5 to actually upload.
#3A unassigned write a simple example that received a filename over a channel
#3B Done    Write a sha256 and aes512 example.

#4	Unassigned 	P2P server - speaks the p2p protocol for trading blobs, 
               	including those from the uploader.  Depends on #5 protocol and 
               	#1 init file.  Continuously trades blobs, makes challenges, 
               	accepts challenges monitors and maintains redundancy.
#4a Unassigned	get test case with a few unique blobs each to successfully 
				transfer blobs between peers.

#5  Unassigned 	implement code to implement p2p protocol (see protocol.txt) 
         		between SSL connected peers.  Connections should only be 
               	allowed to complete if the peer presents the public key in 
				the sqlite database that tracks peers.

#6	spikebike  implement REQUEST, REPLY, and GET.  See protocol.txt
               REQUEST partially completed.
#6A Done       Write a client/server that uses protobuf over SSL to handle RPC
