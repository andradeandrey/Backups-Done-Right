# Backups-Done-Right

Backups-Done-Right is a P2P backup program providing easy, fast and secure encrypted off-site backups.


## Features

* files encrypted with AES256 before they go over the network
* Server does not have to have the clients encryption key
* fast filesystem walker
* posibility to run more than one fs walker at once (performance scales with number of spindles)
* simple configuration - just one config file
* simple installation (static linked build)
* restores with permissions, symlinks etc.
* backups are stored encrypted - you don't need to trust in your sysadmin
* encryption key does not get transfered - you always keep the key on your side


## Potential Misfeatures

* No back doors - without the clients AES256 key no recovery is possible
* No bare metal restores - Backups Does Right depends on Go + working OS, 
		and AES256 key for a restore.  For connections to peers 
		one of (old IP address or IP address of peers) is needed.
* Some metadata is lost on cross platform restores.  Go's stat implementation
		is used.  Backups done right is only as cross platform compatible
 		as go.
* Owner of AES256 key *MUST* make copies to protect against lost.  Multiple
		Printouts and/or thumbdrives in secure locations (not in the same 
		building) are recommended to insure recovery.

## Technical Overview

The walker tracks filesystem metadata in sqlite.  During each walker invocation all configured directories are walked looking for new or changed files.  Any new or changed files are encrypted (AES-256) and checksummed (SHA256).  

The walker then attempts to upload the encrypted blobs to the server.  The servers public key is checked.  Any non-duplicated (sha256 blobs the server doesn't already have) files are uploaded.

Server <-> server connections are used to replicated blobs to the configured redundancy.  Only known public keys are trusted and all communications happen over an SSL connection.

Peers are periodically challenged to prove they have the blobs they claim to be storing.  This also allows for disaster recovery (assuming the AES256 key is available) by waiting for challenges from your peers.
